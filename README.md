A simple application in plain JavaScript using the model-view-controller architectural pattern. This is my first project that implies the method of MVC(Model, View and Controller) into Electron Framework.

I made this todo app, which is a simple little browser app that allows CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) todos. 
It just consists of an index.html, header.css, and script.js(mvc-localstorage, mvc_sqlite-dbstorage), nice and simple and dependenc for learning purposes.

üí° How to run the program:

!!! / ‚ö†Ô∏è<span style="color:red">Warning</span>: Running the application in C:\Users\daniel\Desktop\electron-app\dist\win-unpacked\Todo-List.exe 
todo.db will not able to display read/write data.

- To build **Window** desktop application installer simply do command "npm run build"
- To run it raw in terminal simply do command "npm start"
