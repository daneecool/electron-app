A simple application in plain JavaScript using the model-view-controller architectural pattern. So I did, and here it is. 
Hopefully it helps understand MVC, as it's a difficult concept to wrap your head around when you're first starting out.

I made this todo app, which is a simple little browser app that allows you to CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) todos. 
It just consists of an index.html, style.css, and script.js, so nice and simple and dependency/framework-free for learning purposes.
